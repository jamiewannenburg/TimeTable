Here I will document how my timetable program works, as I build a GUI for it.

The main program is "timetable.py". This is where the UI lives. 
It loads the web page and parses it in a sorted csv file.
The web page presents the data in the form of a string "year/subject/group/language/lecture"


Display functions has functions that factor out code that has to do with 
interaction with ther user.
