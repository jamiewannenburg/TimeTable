Time Table
==========

Calculates your time table at university of pretoria. Uploads to google drive.

To download the latest version go to the folder "binaries/windows" and download the latest .zip file by clicking view raw. Or clicking https://raw.github.com/jamiewannenburg/TimeTable/master/binaries/windows/TimeTable_v0-002.zip . Extract to a folder of your choice. Feel free to rename the 'dist' folder. Then run "TimeTable.exe".

Note: I don't believe the mac version works.
